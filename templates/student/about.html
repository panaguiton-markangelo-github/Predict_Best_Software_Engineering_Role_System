                                    Having been studied since 1917, MBTI can be considered the most popular method of personality examination today. MBTI stands for Myers-Briggs Type Indicator – a method of personality identification through a series of multiple-choice questions of 16 personality groups. This method of personality indicator is derived from the taxonomy theories in the book Psychological Types of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung, published in 1921 and developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, from around World War II. Psychological questions initially evolved into the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and published in 1962.

                                    The MBTI personality test is based on each person’s responses to infer their unique personalities. MBTI answers the question of why everyone in the world has a different character and no one is the person. Today, MBTI is gaining popularity and used as a fairly accurate personality classification method, helping people understand themselves and those around them or pursue suitable careers.

                                    Developmental psychologist at Harvard University Howard Gardner developed the theory of Multiple Intelligences. According to Gardner, people have different kinds of intelligences, and the Multiple Intelligences framework is fairer than IQ tests, which only measure one type of aptitude. The theory of Multiple Intelligences enjoys considerable popularity among educators, with many teachers using it in the classroom to help young people discover their path in life.

                                    The IDRlabs Multiple Intelligences (MI) Test (IDR-MIT) was developed by IDRlabs. The IDR-MIT is based on the work of Dr. Howard Gardner, who authored the Multiple Intelligences Theory. The IDR-MIT is not associated with any specific researchers in the field of educational psychology or any affiliated research institutions.

                                    The IDRlabs Multiple Intelligences Test was informed by Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences Model, as published in Gardner, Howard (1983; 1993) Frames of Mind: The theory of multiple intelligences, New York: Basic Books; Gardner, Howard (1999) Intelligence Reframed. Multiple intelligences for the 21st century, New York: Basic Books; Brualdi, A, C. (1996) ‘Multiple Intelligences: Gardner’s Theory. ERIC Digest’,Eric Digests.

                                    The work of Dr. Gardner has also informed some of the criteria in the form of the widely used educational and psychological model, the Multiple Intelligences Theory, for academic and psychological use especially by qualified professionals in the academe. The present test is intended for educational purposes only.
